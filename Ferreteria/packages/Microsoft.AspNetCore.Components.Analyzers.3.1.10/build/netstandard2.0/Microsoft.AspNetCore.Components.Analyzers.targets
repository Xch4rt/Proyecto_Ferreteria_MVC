  The Web.SDK unconditionally adds the components analyzer to all qualifying Web projects. A project qualifiies if it targets netcoreapp3.0 or later and does not have a flag that
  prevents the implicit analyzer from being added. We want to ensure that when a Web project also references this package, typically as the result of referencing a component class library,
  the analyzer in the SDK always wins.

  "ResolvedAnalyzers" contains the list of analyzers that are resolved from package references. "Analyzer" contains the list of of analyzers used by the compiler.
  The ResolveLockFileAnalyzers target copies items from ResolvedAnalyzers to Analyzer.

  The target below runs before ResolveLockFileAnalyzers executes. If it discovers that the Analyzer item group was previously populated by the WebSDK, it prevents the analyzer from the package
  from being used by removing it from the ResolvedAnalyzers list.

  Note: Prior to 3.1.3, this package prevented the analyzer from the SDK from being used by setting DisableImplicitComponentsAnalyzers=true. This would have prevented newer versions of the analyzer
  from the SDK from ever being used. A compilation of SDK and package version combinations:

  Package Version         SDK Version     Result
  ==================================================
  Earlier than 3.1.3      Any            Package wins
  3.1.3 or newer          Any            SDK wins
